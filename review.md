Review Environment

Submission ID: beae0ddb-1f0d-45ac-b3ff-3fbaa452b9fc
Review date: November 17, 2025
Version reviewed: 1.3


Guideline 4.1 - Design - Copycats


The app or its metadata appears to contain potentially misleading references to third-party content.

Specifically, the app includes content that leverages the popularity of Jennie Kim without the necessary authorization.

Next Steps

If you have the necessary rights to distribute an app with this third-party content, attach documentary evidence in the App Review Information section in App Store Connect and reply to this message. 

If you do not have the necessary rights to the third-party content, It would be appropriate to revise the app and metadata to remove the third-party content before resubmitting for review.

Guideline 2.1 - Performance - App Completeness


We found that your in-app purchase products exhibited one or more bugs which create a poor user experience. 

Specifically, when we attempted to obtain any in-app purchases, we are presented with an error message. 

Review device details: 

- Device type: iPad Air (5th generation) 
- OS version: iPadOS 26.1

Next Steps

When validating receipts on your server, your server needs to be able to handle a production-signed app getting its receipts from Apple’s test environment. The recommended approach is for your production server to always validate receipts against the production App Store first. If validation fails with the error code "Sandbox receipt used in production," you should validate against the test environment instead.


Guideline 2.1 - Performance - App Completeness


We are unable to complete the review of the app because one or more of the in-app purchase products have not been submitted for review.

Specifically, the app includes references to 美美币 and 月度会员 but the associated in-app purchase products have not been submitted for review. 

Next Steps

To resolve this issue, please be sure to take action and submit your in-app purchases and upload a new binary in App Store Connect so we can proceed with our review. 

Note you must provide an App Review screenshot in App Store Connect in order to submit in-app purchases for review. Learn more about required in-app purchase metadata.

Guideline 5.1.1 - Legal - Privacy - Data Collection and Storage


We noticed the app includes features and functionality that use face data but the provided privacy policy does not include the following required information: 

- An explicit statement that face data is not retained. 
- Your reasons for storing face data.
- The length of time face data is stored and why you store it this specific length of time. Note that it is not appropriate to store face data indefinitely. 
- Which third parties you share face data with.
- Your reasons for sharing face data with third parties. 
- Whether or not the third parties you share face data with also store face data. If they do store face data, your privacy policy must describe the privacy practices of these third parties, including why they store face data, the length of time the face data will be stored, and why the face data will be stored for this length of time. 

To protect the user's security and privacy, developers must provide privacy policies that thoroughly explain their app's data collection and storage practices.

Next Steps

To resolve this issue, update your privacy policy to include all the required information and then provide a link to your updated privacy policy in the App Privacy section for this app in App Store Connect. If your privacy policy already includes this information, respond to this message with the relevant sections quoted in your reply.

Guideline 5.1.1(v) - Data Collection and Storage

Issue Description

The app supports account creation but does not include an option to initiate account deletion. Apps that support account creation must also offer account deletion to give users more control of the data they've shared while using an app.

Follow these requirements when updating an app to support account deletion:

- Only offering to temporarily deactivate or disable an account is insufficient.
- If users need to visit a website to finish deleting their account, include a link directly to the website page where they can complete the process.
- Apps may include confirmation steps to prevent users from accidentally deleting their account. However, only apps in highly-regulated industries may require users to use customer service resources, such as making a phone call or sending an email, to complete account deletion.

Next Steps

Update the app to support account deletion. If the app already supports account deletion, reply to App Review in App Store Connect and identify where to locate this feature.

If the app is unable to offer account deletion or needs to provide additional customer service flows to facilitate and confirm account deletion, either because the app operates in a highly-regulated industry or for some other reason, reply to App Review in App Store Connect and provide additional information or documentation. For questions regarding legal obligations, check with legal counsel.
