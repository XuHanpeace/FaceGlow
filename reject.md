Next Steps


Provide complete and detailed responses to the following questions:


- What face data does the app collect?

- Provide a complete and clear explanation of all planned uses of the collected face data.

- Will the face data be shared with any third parties? Where will this information be stored?

- How long will face data be retained?

- Where in the privacy policy is the app's collection, use, disclosure, sharing, and retention of face data explained? Identify the specific sections in the privacy policy where this information is located.
