Issue Description

The submission did not include all the required information for apps offering auto-renewable subscriptions.

The app's metadata is missing the following required information:

Resources

Apps offering auto-renewable subscriptions must include all of the following required information in the binary:

- Title of auto-renewing subscription (this may be the same as the in-app purchase product name)
- Length of subscription
- Price of subscription, and price per unit if appropriate
- Functional links to the privacy policy and Terms of Use (EULA)

Next Steps

- Provide a complete and clear explanation of all planned uses of the collected face data.
- Will the face data be shared with any third parties? Where will this information be stored?
- How long will face data be retained? 
- Where in the privacy policy is the app's collection, use, disclosure, sharing, and retention of face data explained? Identify the specific sections in the privacy policy where this information is located.
